# Real-time-gesture-control-system


## Problem Statement:

"Design a lightweight real-time gesture-based control system for browser navigation aimed at accessibility enhancement for individuals with motor disabilities."

## Project Overview:
Develop a webcam-based gesture recognition system that maps simple hand gestures (like swipe left/right, thumbs up/down, etc.) to common browser actions such as:

Going back or forward in history

Scrolling up/down

Opening/closing tabs

Refreshing page

This system would provide an alternative interface for users with limited mobility, helping them interact with the web without using a keyboard or mouse.

## Unique Ideology:

Unlike typical gesture recognition projects, this one focuses on low-resource environments, using lightweight models or OpenCV + MediaPipe, and emphasizes practical daily utility in web navigation — something rarely targeted in CV projects.

## Core Features:

Real-time webcam capture

Hand gesture detection using MediaPipe or YOLO-Nano/Tiny

Gesture-to-command mapping (e.g., swipe right → “next tab”)

System that hooks into browser events (with a simple browser extension or automation)

Minimal UI to display detected gesture + action

## Tools You Can Use:

Python + OpenCV + MediaPipe (for gesture detection)

Flask/FastAPI (for bridging gesture recognition to browser)

pyautogui / Selenium / Puppeteer (for browser control simulation)

## Optional: Create a tiny browser extension to send commands

Stretch Goals (if time permits):

Customizable gesture-action mapping via UI

Voice feedback for actions taken

Support for more gestures (pinch, circle, etc.)

Cross-platform support


## streching goals

Refine your gesture detection accuracy

Add thresholds or confidence scores to reduce false positives
Implement a small delay/cooldown between gesture activations to prevent accidental triggers
Consider adding visual feedback when a gesture is recognized


Expand functionality

Add more complex gestures for additional browser actions (zoom in/out, switch tabs, etc.)
Create customizable gesture mappings so users can set their preferred gestures
Implement a "gesture combo" system for more advanced operations


Improve the user experience

Add a calibration system that adapts to different users' hand sizes and gestures
Implement a "learning mode" that helps users practice gestures
Create an on-screen guide showing available gestures


Handle edge cases

Implement proper error handling for when hand tracking fails
Add lighting and background adaptability
Consider how to handle multiple hands in frame


Performance optimization

Profile your code to identify and fix any performance bottlenecks
Reduce CPU/memory usage for smoother operation
Implement frame skipping if necessary for real-time performance
